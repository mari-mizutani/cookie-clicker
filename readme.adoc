Java script exercise

= Cookie Clicker

https://mari-mizutani.github.io/cookie-clicker/

It was a good exercise to improve my basic knowledge of js.
I've got stuck lots of the times, but it was mostly the problem
which I don't write the code the right place.

For set the time limitation of bonus button, I used if and else if statement.
But I originally wanted to write the code with "setInterval" method.
It is my next goal when I update this game.
